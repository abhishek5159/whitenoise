This is an Android app that plays white, pink, and brown noise.

Most white noise apps lack features that I would like to have, so I'm making my own app. Those features are:
* Sleep timer
* Oscillating volume
* Fading volume
* Status bar controls

Additionally most of the existing apps are ugly/outdated, so I'm attempting to use a simple Material design.

I've finished the main features of the app and it's available on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dalbers.com.noise "App Link").
